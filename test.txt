ACT I. SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO.

BER. Who's there?

FRAN. Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BER. Long live the king!

FRAN. Bernardo?

BER. He.

FRAN. You come most carefully upon your hour.

BER. 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRAN. For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.

BER. Have you had quiet guard?

FRAN. Not a mouse stirring.

BER. Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS.

FRAN. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

HOR. Friends to this ground.

MARC. And liegemen to the Dane.

FRAN. Give you good night.

MARC. O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?

FRAN. Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.

Exit Francisco.

MARC. Holla! Bernardo!

BER. Say,
What, is Horatio there?

HOR. A piece of him.

BER. Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARC. What, has this thing appeared again to-night?

BER. I have seen nothing.

MARC. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

HOR. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

BER. Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.

HOR. Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

BER. Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,

Enter Ghost.

MARC. Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

BER. In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

MARC. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

BER. Looks he not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

HOR. Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

BER. It would be spoke to.

MARC. Question it, Horatio.

HOR. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

MARC. It is offended.

BER. See, it stalks away!

HOR. Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

Exit Ghost.

MARC. 'Tis gone, and will not answer.

BER. How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?  
What think you on it?

HOR. Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.

MARC. Is it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

HOR. I think I saw him yesternight;
But, still, I cannot believe it.
...
BER. What, in the name of God, is this?

MARC. It's nothing.

HOR. Come, let us try what we can make of it.
It seems that we're on our watch tonight.
It appears we’ve fallen into another world:
We’ll seek out answers from the wise, my friend.
But now I must return to meet our friends.
To them our secrets must remain concealed.
Let us adjourn from here, and seek our future too.

ACT I. SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.

Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, LAERTES, OPHELIA, HORATIO, MARCELLUS, BERNARDO, and others.

KING CLAUDIUS. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 't were, with a defeated joy,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
Taken to wife: nor shall I now bemoan
I thank my lord and lady. For giving us
This new joy in our hearts, and sorrow on our path
...
KING CLAUDIUS.  
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death  
The memory be green, and that it us befitted  
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom  
To be contracted in one brow of woe,  
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature  
That we with wisest sorrow think on him

Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,

In equal scale weighing delight and dole,  
Taken to wife; nor shall I now bemoan  
I thank my lord and lady. For giving us  
This new joy in our hearts, and sorrow on our path.  

But what of Hamlet? wherefore doth he go?  
His father’s death he’d care to know.

POLONIUS.  
This will bring us no more peace. Let him know our grief.  
The words of a good son are wise,  
And yet Hamlet must heed our advice.

LAERTES.  
It is with much regret I leave your court,  
To return to France, where I've made my mark.

OPHELIA.  
I’ll wait your word, Laertes, though it’s hard.  
For I too wish to leave this sorrowed land.  

HAMLET.  
Oh, that my fate had only been sealed,  
Then would my brother’s face no longer trouble me.

ACT 1, SCENE 2. A Room of State in the Castle.

Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, LAERTES, OPHELIA, and others.

KING CLAUDIUS:  
Although the world is wide and full of sorrow,  
We still must have the right to be glad in spite.  
Our father, dear brother, I mourn with honor,  
That all the world may see we feel the blight.  
Though grief and sorrow are both great afflictions,  
We must yet think on joy in all reflections.  
The memory of our dead, and this our sorrow,  
To guide us through the coming days tomorrow.

POLONIUS:  
Your Majesty, it is so wise to look  
To brighter things in midst of heavy woe.  
Though Hamlet grieves, and seems to be most sick,  
Still we must help him out of pain below.

LAERTES:  
I shall return to France, my noble King,  
To set myself apart and learn some things.  
Our thoughts may lead us far, beyond the seas,  
But let our hearts and minds with wisdom please.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:  
I thank you, son, for your wise and humble view,  
Your absence will be sorely felt, it’s true.  
But though we weep, the world still turns around,  
And here we’ll mourn until the dead are found.

HAMLET:  
O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt,  
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!  
Or that the Everlasting had not fixed  
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!  
How weary, stale, flat, and profitable  
Seem to me all the uses of this world!  
Fie on’t! O fie! ’Tis an unweeded garden  
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature  
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!  
But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two—  
So excellent a king; that was to this  
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother  
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven  
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!  
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him,  
As if increase of appetite had grown  
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month—  
Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!  
A little month, or ere those shoes were old  
With which she followed my poor father’s body,  
Like Niobe, all tears: why she, even she—  
O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason,  
Would have mourned longer—married with my uncle,  
My father’s brother; but no more like my father  
Than I to Hercules: within a month!  
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears  
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,  
She married: O, most wicked speed, to post  
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!  
It is not, nor it cannot come to good;  
But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.

Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.

HORATIO:  
Hail to your lordship!

HAMLET:  
I am glad to see you well:  
Horatio—or I do forget myself.  
My lord, I came to greet you, noble friend,  
For my good purpose reaches far ahead.  
I seek no harm, but wish you well, my friend.

HORATIO:  
I greet you back, good Hamlet, wise and kind.  
The heart of our great nation lies in strife,  
But still we move with great resolve, and light.

HAMLET:  
It seems my thoughts may fail me yet again,  
For all this sorrow has made deep the strain.  
Good Horatio, and you as well, my friends,  
Let’s hope the pain will cease, and fate shall bend.  
But till then, I will endure this strife,  
And though this world is cold, I’ll hold my life.

BER.  
Your thoughts are well received, my noble lord,  
And we shall wait, to see how things restore.  
The world may twist, and fate may yet unroll,  
But in your heart there lies a steadfast soul.

MARCELLUS:  
I too would have no harm to see you go,  
But still, my lord, the times shall show us so.

HAMLET:  
I thank you, friends, for keeping me in mind.  
Though fate may push, our hearts will still be kind.

They exit.
